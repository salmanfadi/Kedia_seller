# Kedia App

## Overview

Kedia App is a modern, scalable, and efficient application designed to provide seamless services using a **gRPC-based microservice framework**. The backend is implemented in Java, deployed using AWS, while the frontend is powered by React Native to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. The app uses JSON for data transfer and integration across services.

---

## Features

- **gRPC Microservices Framework**: Provides high-performance, lightweight, and scalable communication between backend services.
- **AWS Deployment**: Backend services are hosted on AWS for reliability and scalability.
- **JSON Data Format**: Ensures compatibility and ease of data exchange across different services and APIs.
- **React Native Frontend**: Offers a cross-platform solution for Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent and fast user experience.

## Prerequisites

### Backend:
- **Java 17+**
- **Maven**
- **gRPC libraries** (configured via Maven dependencies)
- **AWS Account** for deployment

### Frontend:
- **Node.js 16+**
- **Expo CLI** for React Native
- **npm or Yarn** for package management

### Additional Tools:
- **Docker**: To containerize and deploy the app.
- **AWS CLI**: For managing AWS deployments.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend/` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend/service1
   ```
2. Build and run the microservices:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Ensure the gRPC services are running and listening for requests.

4. Deploy services to AWS:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deployment-scripts.sh
   ```

---

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/KediaApp
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React Native app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
4. Use the Expo Go app or an emulator to test the app on your device.

---

## Deployment

### Using Docker:
1. Build Docker images for the backend and frontend:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
2. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
3. Verify all services are running by accessing the logs or endpoints.

---

## APIs and Integration

- **Backend API**:
  - Communication via gRPC
  - Data format: JSON
  - gRPC endpoints are defined in `proto/service.proto`.

- **Frontend**:
  - Connects to backend gRPC services using intermediary REST APIs or WebSockets.
  - API calls are handled via the `fetch` library.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add more microservices to extend functionality.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Implement advanced monitoring using AWS CloudWatch and Prometheus.
- Expand frontend functionality with user authentication and analytics.
